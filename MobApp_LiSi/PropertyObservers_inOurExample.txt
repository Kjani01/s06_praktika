In our example we see a variable called totalSteps. The willSet 
and didSet methods are hooked with this variable, which you can see
if you look closer at the curly bracked, right after the variable
declaration. So these willSet and didSet work exlusively for this
variable and willSet is called right before the varialbe is set 
and didSet is called right after the variable is set.
